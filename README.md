# Dice-Game-GUI
Project for my Advanced Concepts in Java course.  

The point of the game is that you role a die, the first value from that roll becomes YOUR value, if you role that value again you lose. 
The point is to gain as many points as possible by rolling other values before rolling YOUR value again.  It goes without saying that 
this is a game of chance.
